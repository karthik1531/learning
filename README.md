Problem: To read a line from local file
solution: 1.First we need file system to be present in our program as the program needed to read a 		    file from local machine.
	  2.Give the local file name which we want to read from our local machine in file syatem 		    function.
	  3.As the data read by the system is in binary format you should explicitly 		     convert into string format.
	  4.print the converted string in console.
